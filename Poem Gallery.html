	  <h2>Poetry Gallery By: Alexandria Vasquez</h2>
<p>
  As a poet, every feeling, emotion, experience, person, and place is unique and deserves to be celebrated through the art of poetry. This is why my collection consists of 100 poems that each represent something different, a testament to the diversity of human experiences. From love and heartbreak to joy and sorrow, my poems explore the full spectrum of emotions. One poem in my collection is dedicated to the feeling of nostalgia. It captures those moments when we long for things from our memories that are bittersweet but still hold a special place in our hearts. Another poem explores the complexities of grief and mourning, how we navigate loss and find meaning in the face of tragedy. Each poem paints a vivid picture with its words, taking readers on an emotional journey that touches on various aspects of what it means to be human.<br>

  <div class="desc">What Could’ve Been

Time is something I take for granted
I spend it thinking about what could’ve been
Instead of focusing on what happened

Why didn’t it work out the way I wanted?
Is it me?
Am I the problem?

There are things I will never understand
What happens beyond my control should not be my concern
What goes through someone else's mind I will never know

Obsessing over an idea that never happened
Wishing it happened
I wonder if you think about what could’ve been

<div class="cluster">
  <div class="desc">Our Planet

God’s creation
The planet people take for granted
Looking at pictures of views around the world
Going to those places and experiencing them in real time

Views allow a person to see the world from a new lens
All we need is a new lens from time to time

Wishing

Get out of my mind
I beg to be released
From the fake scenarios 
All these wishes surrounding me

I keep thinking i’ve moved on
Nothing ever happened
But why do I keep you in my mind?
Why are you so important?&nbsp; &nbsp; - AFV</div>

<div class="cluster">
  <div class="desc">I’m Never The One

When will it be my turn?
I wait in vain, patiently 
Waiting for my turn to be seen

I try and try, again and again, over and over
Almost like thrashing through water when drowning
I’m drowning

Drowning in my attempts

When will you finally see me? -AFV
