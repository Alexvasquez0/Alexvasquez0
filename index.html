		<h2>About Author, Alexandria Vasquez</h2>
      <h3> As a senior in high school, I have realized that writing has been my passion since childhood. From short stories to essays, I have always enjoyed putting my thoughts into words. However, it was not until 9th grade when I discovered the beauty of poetry. The ability to express emotions and ideas through carefully crafted words and phrases fascinated me. Since then, poetry has become a significant part of my life. It has allowed me to explore different themes such as love, loss, and self-discovery. Writing poems is therapeutic for me; it helps me reflect on my experiences and emotions in a unique way. Through poetry, I have been able to connect with others who share similar experiences or feelings.<br>
      </h3>
